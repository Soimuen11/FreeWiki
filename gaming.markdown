## GAMING ON LINUX

### False Stereotypes

Nothing is less true than "you cannot play on Linux". Try out these one of
these 3 programs and you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend Steam. It
has entertained me for many an hour.

+ [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/)
+ [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/)
+ [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)

All these programs are well documented in the Arch Wiki. Be careful and install
the proper fonts/dependencies for Steam! All three programs are directly
available with pacman or in the AUR.

### Emulating console games

Many emulators exist. Here are the ones I use and consider as "the best":

1. Nintendo DS (nds): **desmume**
2. GameBoy Advanced (gba): **vbam**
3. PlayStation Portable (psp): **ppsspp**
4. Wii-U: **decaf** OR **Cemu & Wine**
5. PC: **Wine** + **Playonlinux**
6. Wii + Gamecube: **Dolphin**
7. Nintendo 64: **Mupen64plus**
