## WHAT TO EXPECT

This wiki aims at providing a quick answer or links to resources. It is
organized in pages:
+ Home: A brief presentation of the wiki, its author and where to contact him.
+ Issues: A short list (for now) of issues / errors I have had as a linux user.
+ Tips & Tricks: Find various commands and links to helpful software
+ Ffmpeg: Commands one can use for screencasting
+ Resources: Links to online resources (blogs, courses, videos, official docs)
+ Scripts: As the title barely indicates, scripts I have written to make my
  life easier on my Linux machine.
