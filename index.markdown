Starting June 4th 2020, this wiki will be a collection of all the issues I,
Phil Wayne, have faced and will face on my Linux machine. It remains
incomplete, since I have encountered many an issue, yet it shall grow over
time, from this day forth. If you have any suggestions, do not hesitate to
contact me or make your own fork.
